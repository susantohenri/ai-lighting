<p>The ai Lighting highbay replacement program is designed to provide Victorian electricians an opportunity to compete against the large lighting upgrade companies in the very lucrative, LED highbay upgrade space.</p>
<p>The program will suit Electricians that:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-indent: -18.0pt;">Have access to job leads.</li>
<li style="text-indent: -18.0pt;">Are keen sales people and willing to generate their own leads.</li>
<li style="text-indent: -18.0pt;">Are already generating leads but would like better value.</li>
</ul>
<p>ai Lighting does not provide job leads but can assist those willing to sell with sales tools and walk in sales strategy.</p>
<p>The program is best suited to Registered Electrical Contracting Companies (REC&rsquo;s) but there are also options for Licenced A Class Electricians to participate under a different arrangement as ai Lighting is also a REC.</p>
<p><strong>How it works</strong></p>
<p>ai Lighting becomes your lighting supplier and VEEC certificate creation partner. We pass on our LED buying power at cost and take a small margin on the VEECs created for compiling and submitting the VEEC claim.</p>
<p>Once the claim has ben accepted and is complete, a purchase order is raised and the revenue generated from the VEECs is paid to you minus materials cost.</p>
<p>You can also supply your own LED lighting if you choose. If you supply your own lighting, a proof of purchase/ invoice must be provided and the products must be VEET approved.</p>
<p>Payment is made to you between approximately 5-10 working days after the claim is accepted.</p>
<p><strong>Eligible businesses</strong></p>
<p>Most commercial buildings are eligible to create VEECS. The Exceptions are:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-indent: -18.0pt;">Lighting already replaced under the VEET</li>
<li style="text-indent: -18.0pt;">Sites that are registered in the EREP list (see here)</li>
</ul>
<p>Not all sites create the same amount of VEECs. There are three main categories:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-indent: -18.0pt;">5000 hours: Warehouses, Retail, Storage, Manufacturing work shops</li>
<li style="text-indent: -18.0pt;">3000 hours: Automotive repairs and servicing</li>
<li style="text-indent: -18.0pt;">2000 hours: Halls and Gyms</li>
</ul>
<p>Its important to understand these categories to make sure you don&rsquo;t underestimate a job or over-promise an upgrade to a prospective customer.</p>
<p>Itemised pricing for each operating hour category will be available on the pricing page and a confirmation of the annual operating hours can be easily made during the initial project discussion.</p>
<p><strong>Minimum quantities</strong></p>
<p>ai Lighting generates it income based on volume. For highbay volumes between 1-5 a minimum charge of $500.00 ex GST is deducted from the VEEC revenue and for highbay quantities between 6-10 a charge of $250.00 ex GST is deducted from the VEEC revenue. The creation process is lengthy and these minimum charges help keep the service available.</p>
<p><strong>VEEC Price</strong></p>
<p>The VEEC price although quite stable can fluctuate up or down and pay back prices are updated daily on the app. The prices are updated between 10:00am &ndash; 12:00pm daily. The fluctuations are usually between 10 cents and 1 dollar either up or down. This can represent between $1.00 - $10.00 per fitting. ai Lighting take steps to minimise these fluctuations and on larger projects, prices can be locked in.</p>
<p><strong>The Process</strong></p>
<p>When you have a prospective job, you register it via a form through the app. An ai Lighting representative will get in touch with you and discuss details.</p>
<p>Once ai Lighting confirms that the project is eligible and what products will be suitable for the application, you can confirm your offer with your customer and if accepted, begin the installation process. For comprehensive instructions on how to conduct a VEET project, please see the &lsquo;Project Process&rsquo; section accessed from the main menu.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Products are listed on the &lsquo;Highbays and Pricing&rsquo; section of the app. Each item will has details such as availability, Spec sheet and Installed payback price.</p>
<p>The &lsquo;Installed payback price&rsquo; is what you earn per fitting ex GST. This price already includes cost of the fitting and the ai Lighting submission fee. Your installation costs must be factored into this price. These include time, access equipment and any ancillary costs associated with the installation including any minimum quantity charges that are mentioned above.</p>

<table class="table table-responsive table-bordered">
	<thead class="text-center">
	<th class="text-center">Highbay Quantity</th>
	<th class="text-center">Pay back price per fitting</th>
	<th class="text-center">Total</th>
	</thead>
	<tbody class="text-center">
		<td>30</td>
		<td>$200.00</td>
		<td>$ 6,000.00</td>
	</tbody>
</table>
<p>Depending on the value of the &lsquo;Pay back Price&rsquo; per fitting, you can choose to conduct the entire installation at no charge for the customer if the total amount will cover all your installation costs and provide you a profit.</p>
<p>If you wish to charge a co-payment, you are entitled to do so as long as it is provided to the customer in a quotation, is approved and a copy of the customer invoice is provided to ai Lighting to be submitted with evidence.</p>
<p>Depending on the size of the job, materials and can be delivered to site. This will be assessed and negotiated on a job by job basis.</p>
<p>A number of evidence items are required to make a claim. A more detailed description of this can be found in the &lsquo;Process instructions&rsquo; section of the app.</p>
<p>Each project requires</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-indent: -18.0pt;">Before photos</li>
<li style="text-indent: -18.0pt;">After photos</li>
<li style="text-indent: -18.0pt;">Hand drawn before and after floor plan</li>
<li style="text-indent: -18.0pt;">CES copy</li>
<li style="text-indent: -18.0pt;">Invoice copy</li>
<li style="text-indent: -18.0pt;">A copy of the lease or evidence of the building class (will be discussed in the initial conversation)</li>
<li style="text-indent: -18.0pt;">Drop off or collection of the removed lighting (for recycling)</li>
</ul>
<p>ai Lighting digitises the floor plans, produces a simulated lighting report and compiles the documentation into a pack and submits it to be processed.</p>
<p>If further information is required, ai Lighting will work closely with you to collect any more information required.</p>
<p>If there are tubes or other types of lighting you wish to upgrade, make mention of this in the initial project discussion.</p>
